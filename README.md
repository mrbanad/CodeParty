 This repository is very similar to his name because I like to put my code in it maybe someone want to used :D
 Each code and folder is loaded separately and has nothing to do with each other
 Those that are a subset of frontend code include javascript, css, and html
 the ones under the backend folder contain C # code with .net core.
the ones under the full folder are topics that include both frontend and backend

last word : This is a party. Anyone can participate, who has no responsibility for the people who use this code here, and whoever uses this code must take full responsibility for using this code.
